# BasicCalculator

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Using The Calculator

After hosting the app on localhost, click the buttons to add them to the screen.
To work with negative numbers, the '+/-' will toggle between negative and positive numbers. You must have a number on screen to toggle it.
For example: to enter -9, press 9 and then '+/-' -> -9, press '+/-' again to get 9.

After performing a calculation, remember to press the 'C' button to clear the screen or else the numbers will keep on adding to the screen.

You can also chain calculations by pressing an operation key and the number you want to continue with.
For example: you can do 9 -> x -> 9 -> x -> 9 to get 729
